 *
 * <p>Status information about the process.  This is used by ps(1). It is defined in the kernel

 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>pid  %d The process ID.</li>
 * <li>comm  %s The filename of the executable, in parentheses. This is visible whether or not
 * the executable is swapped out.</li>
 * <li>state  %c One of the following characters, indicating process state:
 * <ul>
 * <li>R  Running</li>
 * <li>S  Sleeping in an interruptible wait</li>
 * <li>D  Waiting in uninterruptible disk sleep</li>
 * <li>Z  Zombie</li>
 * <li>T  Stopped (on a signal) or (before Linux 2.6.33) trace stopped</li>
 * <li>t  Tracing stop (Linux 2.6.33 onward)</li>

 * <li>P  Parked (Linux 3.9 to 3.13 only)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>ppid %d The PID of the parent of this process.</li>
 * <li>pgrp %d The process group ID of the process.</li>
 * <li>session %d The session ID of the process.</li>
 * <li>tty_nr %d The controlling terminal of the process.  (The minor device number is contained
 * in the combination of bits 31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device number is in bits 15 to 8.)
 * </li>
 * <li>tpgid %d The ID of the foreground process group of the controlling terminal of the
 * process.</li>
 * <li>flags %u The kernel flags word of the process.  For bit meanings, see the PF_* defines in
 * the Linux kernel source file include/linux/sched.h.  Details depend on the kernel version.
 * The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.</li>
 * <li>minflt %lu The number of minor faults the process has made which have not required
 * loading a memory page from disk.</li>
 * <li>cminflt %lu The number of minor faults that the process's waited-for children have

 * made</li>
 * <li>utime  %lu Amount of time that this process has been scheduled in user mode, measured in
 * clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).  This includes guest time,   guest_time (time
 * spent running a virtual CPU, see below), so that applications that are not aware of the guest
 * time field do not lose that time from their calculations.</li>
 * <li>stime  %lu Amount of time that this process has been scheduled in kernel mode, measured
 * in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).</li>
 * <li>cutime  %ld Amount of time that this process's waited-for children have been scheduled in

 * This includes guest time, cguest_time (time spent running a virtual CPU, see below).</li>
 * <li>cstime  %ld Amount of time that this process's waited-for children have been scheduled in
 * kernel mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).</li>
 * <li>priority  %ld (Explanation for Linux 2.6) For processes running a real-time scheduling
 * policy (policy below; see sched_setscheduler(2)), this is the negated scheduling priority,
 * minus one; that is, a number in the range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time priorities 1
 * to 99.  For processes running under a non-real-time scheduling policy, this is the raw nice
 * value (setpriority(2)) as represented in the kernel.  The kernel stores nice values as numbers
 * in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to the user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.
 * Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on the scheduler weighting given to this

 * this field was hard coded to 0 as a placeholder for an earlier removed field.</li>
 * <li>itrealvalue  %ld The time in jiffies before the next SIGALRM is sent to the process due
 * to an interval timer.  Since kernel 2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained, and is hard
 * coded as 0.</li>

 * ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)).</li>
 * <li>The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.  (23) vsize  %lu Virtual memory size
 * in bytes.</li>
 * <li>rss  %ld Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has in real memory.  This is just
 * the pages which count toward text, data, or stack space.  This does not include pages which
 * have not been demand-loaded in, or which are swapped out.</li>
 * <li>rsslim  %lu Current soft limit in bytes on the rss of the process; see the description of
 * RLIMIT_RSS in getrlimit(2).</li>

 * <li>kstkesp  %lu The current value of ESP (stack pointer), as found in the kernel stack page
 * for the process.</li>
